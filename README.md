Image Processing: 

This repository contains a series of lab programs and exercises designed to help students and learners explore and understand the fundamental concepts of Image Processing. Each program is implemented using Python and popular libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Pillow, and aims to provide hands-on experience in image manipulation and analysis.

Overview:

The repository covers a wide range of image processing techniques, starting from basic operations to more advanced tasks, offering practical learning experiences. Each lab program is accompanied by explanations of key concepts and methodologies used in the implementation. The goal is to bridge the gap between theory and practical application in image processing.

Key Learnings::

1.Basic Image Manipulation: Loading, saving, and displaying images using Python.
2.Image Filtering: Applying linear and non-linear filters like Gaussian, median, and custom filters.
3.Edge Detection: Techniques like Sobel and Canny edge detection to identify object boundaries.
4.Image Enhancement: Techniques to adjust image brightness, contrast, and perform histogram equalization.
5.Geometric Transformations: Scaling, rotation, translation, and affine transformations.
6.Thresholding and Segmentation: Identifying objects within an image using techniques like global and adaptive thresholding.
7.Morphological Operations: Applying operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing for shape analysis.
8.Feature Detection and Extraction: Identifying key features in images, including corners and contours.
9.Object Detection: Implementing simple object detection using color-based or feature-based methods.
